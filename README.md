### `npm install`

Install all dependencies.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `improvements`

Obviously being under some time constraint we don't always follow best practices to get a working prototype. But with that said none of these items are necessarily 'bad' practices.

Next pass on the code I would probably fix up:

- Defining class methods using arrow functions when they are only used within the class.
- Defining style props objects on the fly
- Creating callback functions while rendering
